<h1>Brutus's Movie List</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Fifth Element</h3>
<p>The direction and editing make this film a masterpiece. I love how beautifully Luc Besson weaves the dialogue from one shot to interact with the next one. It's loads of fun and endlessly quotable.</p>
<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>Yes, I know it's three movies and I do mean the extended edition. It's a brilliant adaptation of three equally brilliant novels. It has some flaws, but I adore it.</p>
<h3>Dead Poet's Society</h3>
<p>This movie touched me deeply. It is a wonderful ode to life itself and celebrates how amazing, complex, thrilling, difficult and ephemeral it is.</p>
